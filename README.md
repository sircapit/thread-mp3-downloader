# thread-mp3-downloader
Basic tool for personal use, but you can give it a try! Just to optimize the process of downloading multiple .mp3 YouTube videos. 

It was used Multithreading in order to accomplish the latter ;). 

### How do I run this? 

Clone this repository anywhere you want:

```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/GTrigueiro/thread-mp3-downloader.git
```

And start the main script by giving the urls on the line: 

```bash
python3 ytmp3.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xx_2XNxxfA
```

#### Remember: this was developed with the intent of being a personal tool, therefore, issues may not be fixed since I know I won't try to break it :B.
